1. Where would you fit your automated tests in your Recipe project development pipeline? Select one of the following and explain why.
* We would fit our automated tests within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed. This is so that every time code is being pushed, it is tested without doubt. This way, no one can "forget" to test their code.

2. Would you use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output?
* No, unit testing would be better for checking if a function is returning the correct output.
